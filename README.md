Bingxin Zhang, Lina Zhang, Chunke Tan

This project is intended as the final project for EECS 351 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing.

Dependency: Audio System Toolbox, VOICEBOX, MATLAB

To run the program with GMM, download VOICEBOX from here: http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/voicebox/voicebox.html. Put it in the root folder and run `Main.m`.

It will run with pre-processing, pitch and MFCC as features, GMM and KNN for classification on the self-collected English data set.
